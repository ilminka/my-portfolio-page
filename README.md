## Description

This webpage introduces myself, as well as the projects that I have worked on at Epicodus thus far. The site includes an "About Me" section and a section that links each my projects to the repositories on GitHub. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were used to write and style the webpage.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Create a new directory call "my-portfolio-page" on your desktop.
* Open the GitHub repository that I created for the portfolio project.
* Clone the repository, with the command "git clone [repository url]", into the local directory.
* Open code with the command "atom ."

Here is a link to the project in GitHub. https://github.com/ilminka/my-portfolio-page
