            <h2>A little about Myself..</h2>
            <p>I first became interested in programming while working with front-end and back-end developers at my agency job. I was always excited to work with them, as it consistently proved to be an opportunity to learn something new. I enjoyed the work that I did with them <em>so much</em>, that I decided to take Epicodus' Intro to Programming course to see if this is a direction that I'd like to go with my career. So far I've really enjoyed it!</p>
            <p>Here's a little bit more about myself and what I've been up to.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><u>Interests and hobbies</u>: Some of my other interests include photography, design, and visual storytelling. When I'm not working or in class, I can usually be found working on art projects, writing, or reading up on the various subjects listed above.</li>
              <br>
              <li><u>Education</u>: I graduated from the <strong>University of Oregon</strong> with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Creative Advertsing. I graduated in 2012 and have lived in Portland ever since.</li>
              <br>
              <li><u>Job Experience</u>: Once I moved to Portland I got a job working at <strong>Revelry Agency</strong>. I worked there as a producer for five years, between 2012-2017.</li>

            <h2>My Epicodus Projects</h2>
            <p>Here are the projects that I have worked on during the Intro to Programming class so far. The languages used for each project are highlighted in green.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/Web-page-1">My first webpage</a>: This is the first project that I worked on in class. This project includes my "first webpage" and "favorite things" pages, and was written in <span class="language">html</span>.</li>
              <br>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/my-pet-webpage">My Pet's Project</a>: For this project I created a simple <span class="language">html</span> webpage for my dog Vitto. I also incorporated some of the <span class="language">css</span> styling that I learned in a later class.</li>
              <br>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/cupcake">Hoodoo Cupcakes Webpage</a>: This website was written with <span class="language">html</span> and <span class="language">css</span> stylesheet. This site incorporates divs and spans, which we learned in class that day.</li>
              <br>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/vacation-site">Vacation Site to Costa Rica</a>: The vacation site was the first site that I used the <span class="language">bootstrap</span> stylesheet on. The website was also written in <span class="language">html </span> and <span class="language">css</span>.</li>
              <br>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/wikipedia-copy">Wikipedia Copy</a>: For this project we worked to replicate the wikipedia landing page as best as we could. This was a great exercise in learning how to use rows and columns, as well as combining <span class="language">bootstrap</span> styling elements with our personal <span class="language">css</span> stylsheet elements.</li>
