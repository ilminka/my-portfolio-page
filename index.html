      <h2>A little about Myself..</h2>
      <p>I first became interested in programming while working with several front-end and back-end developers at Reverly Agency. I was always excited to work with them, as it consistently proved to be an opportunity to learn something new. I enjoyed the work that I did with them so much, that I am considering a switch into front-end development. I decided to take this course to see if this is a path that I would like to pursue.</p>
      <p>Here's a little bit about what else I've been up to.</p>
