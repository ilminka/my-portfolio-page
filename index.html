    <h2>A little about Myself..</h2>
    <p>I first became interested in programming while working with several front-end and back-end developers at my previous agency. I was always excited to work with them, as it consistently proved to be an opportunity to learn something new.

      <h2>My Epicodus Projects</h2>
      <p>Here are the projects that I have worked on during the Intro to Programming class so far. My favorite projects are highlighted in blue.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/Web-page-1">my first webpage</a>: This is the first project that I worked on in class. This project includes my "first webpage" and "favorite things" pages, and was written in <span class="language">html</span>.</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/my-pet-webpage">my pet project</a>: I created a simple html webpage for my dog Vitto, and incorporated some of the <span class="language">css</span> styling that I learne in later classe.</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/cupcake">cupcake webpage</a>: This website was written with <span class="language">html</span> and <span class="language">css</span> stylesheet. This site incorporates divs and spans, which we learned in class that day.</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ilminka/vacation-site">vacation site</a>: The vacation site was the first site that I deployed the <span class="language">bootstrap</span> stylesheet on.</li>
